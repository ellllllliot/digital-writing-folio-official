# digital-writing-folio-official
Hi! Iâ€™m Elliot and this is my digital writing folio. Woo! During my experiences this semester, I have tried to grasp the concept of digital writing; that is, creative writing in a digital form, that may adopt traditional or abstract and more artistic formats. I have expected to learn writing methods unique to technology and take advantage of expression in ways that simple prose, script or essay, my main formats, do not generally allow. I have found these to be largely cathartic forms of creativity, with both fictional and non-fictional concepts, however, I have recently come to wonder more about the abstract forms of expression. Digital writing seems to lend itself more to those possibilities and I have only gotten more intrigued about how they can motivate me to be creative in unique ways.
